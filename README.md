## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Rohan** .
### About Me
I'm a computer science undergraduate from the University of the Philippines Diliman. Aside from computers, I am passionate about learning math, music theory, and æ—¥æœ¬èªž. I love playing the guitar and bass and sometimes (*read: rarely*) make covers of songs that are fun to play. 
My other hobbies include playing JRPGs and fighting games, watching shows and movies, and reading novels. Someday, I want to stitch my interest in math, music, and computer science into research and contribute to the ever-advancing technology of our world.
